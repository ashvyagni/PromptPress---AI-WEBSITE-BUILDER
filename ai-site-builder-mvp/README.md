## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **frontend** (React + Vite) collects your prompt  
2. The **backend** (Node + Express) sends it to the OpenAI API  
3. The AI generates clean HTML, CSS, and JS  
4. You see a live preview instantly — and can download the output

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # add your OpenAI API key here
